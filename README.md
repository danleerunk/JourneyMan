# JourneyMan
Takes photo and text updates and builds HTML files

This is really my first Windows program, and my first Visual Studio programming experience - naturally, expect this to be very poorly written! You’ve been warned.

JourneyMan was written for use by my family when taking trips. Historically, family members would create a simple journal of the trip by directly editing html to add pictures and text. Obviously that’s a pretty cumbersome way to go about it, so I decided to try and make it a bit easier.

I know you’re thinking right now, “aren’t there a million photo/journal type apps already available or online?” - you’re right. There was a much easier way to do this by using an existing tool, I’m sure.

So you add photos to the program, then add text for each of the photos if desired. You can then “publish” the update, which creates a small directory with the appropriate HTML and resized photos. The idea is then you simply copy that to your server. The lack of automatic upload is mostly because there was not consistent internet access where we were going to make it useful, although one day I may attempt to add that capability.
